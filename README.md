# Russ-Roul
Russian Roulette in C#

You're using a six-shooter handgun, it needs to be cocked to fire. Pulling back the hammer cycles the chambers.
I've left in the chamber information, as if you check the bullets each time, which sort of defeats the purpose of the game. 
Emptied rounds are dropped, note the *ting*s.
No action can be completed after shooting yourself in the head, just like in real life.
